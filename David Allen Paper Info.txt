Assumptions:
	- Acceptable characters for a morse code tree include only alphabetic letters.
	- Capital and lowercase letters are interchangable
	- The number of acceptable characters can not exceed 30.  As such, code lines for code trees cannot exceed six characters.
	- Multi-character tokens care not allowed
	
Choice Justifications:
	- A string was used to contain acceptable characters for input to ease detection of acceptable characters and ease expansion of the acceptable character lists.
	- The code tree is constructed as characters are added to prevent creation of a tree that is unnecessarily large for the needed character set.
	- Multiple characters are allowed for dashes and dots in case other characters are preferred by a user.
	
Runtimes:
	Addition of each character: O(lgn);
	
UML Information:
	Contains one Binary Tree

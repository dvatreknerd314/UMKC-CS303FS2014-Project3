Assumptions:
	- Acceptable characters for a morse code tree include only alphabetic letters.
	- Capital and lowercase letters are interchangable
	- The number of acceptable characters can not exceed 30.  As such, code lines for code trees cannot exceed six characters.
	- Multi-character tokens are not allowed
	- When decoding, multiple words are not supported
	- Extra spaces are ok in a morse code message to be decoded
	- Only 256 characters of input will ever be given for a message to encode or decode
	
	
Choice Justifications:
	- A string was used to contain acceptable characters for input to ease detection of acceptable characters and ease expansion of the acceptable character lists.
	- The code tree is constructed as characters are added to prevent creation of a tree that is unnecessarily large for the needed character set.
	- Multiple characters are allowed for dashes and dots in case other characters are preferred by a user.
	- Decode uses an iterator to move through the string to be decoded
	
Runtimes:
	Decode: O(nlgn);
	Addition of each character: O(lgn);
	
UML Information:
	Contains one Binary Tree
